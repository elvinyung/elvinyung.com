        Hi. I'm Elvin Yung.

        I'm trying to learn as much as possible.

      I made <a href="http://elvinyung.github.io/botstrap/">Botstrap</a> (not to
      be confused with Bootstrap), a framework
      that makes it super simple to make Slack chatbots. It lets you plug together
      completely decoupled modules, and build a chatbot without writing a single
      line of code.

      I am a member of technical staff intern on the dashboard team at
      <a href="https://meraki.cisco.com/">Meraki</a>, working on improving the
      at-scale performance of backend services.
      Meraki is the cloud networking group of a company called
      <a href="http://www.cisco.com/">Cisco</a>. (You may have heard of it.)

      Last summer, I worked at <a href="https://www.affirm.com/">Affirm</a>,
      where I worked on various consumer-facing applications,
      including the checkout flow and user portal dashboard for managing loans.
      Affirm is headed by some really, really awesome people. I learned a lot
      about building products and companies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prior to that, I was at <a href="http://www.eventmobi.com/">EventMobi</a>,
      where I mainly built various systems and tools as part of an effort to offer native
      applications alongside the main web-mobile app for event and conference attendees.

      On top of everything, I'm a computer science student at the
      <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/">University of Waterloo</a>, where I sometimes
      learn things (but mostly just slack off to learn other things).
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm a snob about coffee, JavaScript libraries, science fiction, and food.

      I'm too lazy to summarize the rest of my life, but if you're not bored yet,
      feel free to take a look at my <a href="https://github.com/elvinyung">GitHub</a>,
      <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/elvinyung">LinkedIn</a>, and
      <a href="">website</a>, or shoot me an <a href="mailto:sup@elvinyung.com">email</a>.
